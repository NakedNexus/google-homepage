This will be my first project from The Odin Project.

I will be attempting to replicate the Google search home page using basic HTML and CSS properties.

This will be one of the first projects/builds I've attempted since 
my ITGS classes back at Cape Coral High School in my days of the IB program.

Coming to a close on this project has reminded me just how new and foreign all of this coding is and how difficult it will be to continue on this path. Building something from scratch is entirely different than just following tutorials. 

I learned (re-learned) how to create nav bars and move elements around the page. I still have a lot of basic work ahead of me. But this shitty Google page is a beginning and a good benchmark for future projects.
